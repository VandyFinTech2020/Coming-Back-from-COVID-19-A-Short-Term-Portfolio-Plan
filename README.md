# Project01: Table of Contents
## Getting Started
Initially setting up the scope and the depth of the project was handled by the team as a whole. We spent a couple class days discussing the purpose and more importantly our reason for doing our project. To do this we used a whiteboard application online (WhiteBoard). We felt it was important to extend on the Portfolio Analysis homework assignment but with added complexity. We decided to conduct a financial analysis on 5 unique industry-focused portfolios to properly provide "Harold" with an accurate analysis of how Covid-19 affected the stock market. Below you will find our initial whiteboard where we sketched out roles of team members, data we would use, analysis to conduct and a basis for presentation.

## Loading Data to SQL Database
With the use of Postgres we were able to load in 20 tickers and corresponding close prices for 5 portfolios (Pharma, Financial, Hedge, Communication, Food) and two unique time periods (Pre-Covid, Post-Covid). We made sure to normalize all the tables/data within our database to ensure optimal flexibility and workability. Below you will find our Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and the code we used to create the database(Database SQL).

## Starter Work
There was a lot of effort and iteration that went into our final analysis and presentation. John, Taylor, and Peter spent countless hours perfecting the code to make it standardized allowing plug and play functionality. Below you will find several parts of the iteration process.

## Running Historical Analysis and Monte Carlo Simulation
To help Harold visualize the results of each portfolio we created a plot to show 100 simulations for each portfolio's future returns as well as a bar chart with 90% confidence quantiles built in.

## Presentation
The presentation was this group's bread and butter. Everything from Susan finding just the right powerpoint to Taylor's well-articulated and properly timed presentation. Below you will find the powerpoint deck (PowerPoint).

Overall a super fun project taking advantage of concepts such as Python, Pandas, SQL, and Simulation Visuals.
